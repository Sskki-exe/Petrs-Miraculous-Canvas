# Petrs-Miraculous-Canvas
Petr's Miracle, also called "the Petr–Douglas–Neumann theorem" is a geometric theorem that describes a certain procedure that can be applied to arbitrary polygons to always produce a regular polygon with the same number of sides. This application features a canvas to draw arbitrary polygons on and visualise intermediary polygons that become a corresponding regular polygon.
